## Project Struggles
With this project, I would like to share my fair share of personal struggles. Using React Router to get the appropriate routes to function properly was quite challenging. I did my best to revisit the examples given to me for practice, and after several attempts, I realized that understanding the proper use of endpoints is something that takes time to master in the long run. I hope to be given more opportunities to work on other tasks to better understand web development routes.


##  Project Updates
As I continue to expand this project, I encounter new challenges that allow me to implement new pieces of technology, which will be documented in this README as they are implemented. These are my first encountered problems, and I am attempting to find solutions using as many resources and external sources as possible.



## Project Layout Inspirations
To help me build a reference, the web offers a vast amounts of examples that can be used. In the project example, I used the Costco Travel Website to provide me a template for some of the pages in this site.
