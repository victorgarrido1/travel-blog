## Project struggles 
With this project, I would like to share my fair share of personal struggles. Using React Router to get the appropriate routes to function properly was quite challenging. I did my best to revisit the examples given to me for practice, and after several attempts, I realized that understanding the proper use of endpoints is something that takes time to master in the long run. I hope to be given more opportunities to work on other tasks to better understand web development routes.
